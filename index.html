                that it is provided online. Apart from this, you can get the
                same quality service in the time period determined by experts in
                the field. At the same time, with this method, it makes the
                therapy service accessible for people who live abroad and have
                language problems.

              In order to maintain an atmosphere of understanding in your
              relationship, we strengthen the communication of couples and
              families; we will first aim to express the problems and the
              factors that create these problems, and then to reach rational
              solutions to be put forward by the couples.

              duhan’s approach to therapy is supportive, warm and
              non-judgemental. She works collaboratively with each individual,
              developing an understanding of each person’s unique goals and
              implementing individualised, tailored therapy programs.
            </p>
            <p>
              duhan is experienced in cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT),
              mindfulness-based CBT, and schema-focussed therapy. She also has
              an interest and experience in working with parents and carers
              within the “Integrated Family Intervention Program” framework.

            <p>
              Duhan has been providing psychological assessment and treatment to
              children, adolescents, adults and families for over 8 years. She
              has experience in therapies for anxiety, depression, trauma, sleep

              Spectrum conditions, including Asperger’s Syndrome. Many
              individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) experience
              additional mental health problems, including depression, anxiety,
              obsessive compulsive disorder, tics, and behavioural and emotional
              regulation difficulties. Duhan has acquired substantial experience
              in supporting people who are struggling with multiple mental
              health difficulties. She also has experience in providing therapy
              for the siblings, parents, carers and partners, of people working

              working with children, youth and families grew and she went on to
              do further study. During her postgraduate studies at Sydney
              University, she co-developed the “Emotion-Based Social Skills
              Training Program” for children with High Functioning ASD and their
              families, at Westmead Children’s Hospital. Duhan has also held
              clinical psychologist positions at Randwick Children’s Hospital
              and the University of NSW Child Behaviour Research Clinic.
