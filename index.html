                  The therapy process begins with an initial consultation. The
                  goal of this appointment is for you and your psychologist to
                  work together in getting a thorough understanding of your
                  difficulties, personal and family history and strengths. It is
                  the start of the process of building a trusting and
                  collaborative relationship with your psychologist.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Following this appointment, together you will develop an
                  individualised formulation and treatment plan.
